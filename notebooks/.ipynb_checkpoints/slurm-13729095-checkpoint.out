Warning message:
In initialise_model(backbone = cellpop_backbone, num_cells = num_cells,  :
  Simulations will not generate enough cells to draw num_cells from.
Ideally, `floor(total_time / census_interval) * num_simulations / num_cells` should be larger than 10
Lower the census interval or increase the number of simulations (with simulation_params$experiment_params).
